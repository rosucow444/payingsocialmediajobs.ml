Neither the content of the Sites, nor the links to other websites contained therein, are routinely moderated, screened, approved, reviewed, or endorsed by NSDIGI or any affiliated person or entity. <br />
We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of the information on the Sites. Any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk. We disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by you or any other visitor to the Sites, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents. <br />

<p>AGE AND USER CONTRIBUTION REMOVAL <br />
NSDIGI is not intended for children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on the Sites or on or through any of its features, register on the Sites, use any of the interactive or public comment features on the Sites, or provide any information about yourself to us. See our Privacy Policy for more information about contacting NSDIGI if you believe we have collected information from a child under 13. <br />
NSDIGI allows minors under the age of 18 years old to access, or become Registered Users of, the Sites. Notwithstanding this, if you are a minor under the age of 18 years old and a Registered User you may request removal of your User Contributions posted on the Sites. To request removal of a User Contribution, you must notify us at feedback@nsdigi.com. When you contact NSDIGI to request removal of a User Contribution, we require you to authenticate your status as a Registered User and to identify the particular User Contribution to be removed by providing the (1) URL to the User Contribution, (2) the date and time at which the User Contribution was posted, and (3) the contents of the User Contribution. If you do not properly notify us, authenticate your status as a Registered User, or properly identify the particular User Contribution to be removed, NSDIGI is not required to remove your User Contribution and removal will be in our sole discretion. <br />
Removal of User Contributions from the Sites does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of your User Contributions from the Sites. NSDIGI, in our sole discretion, may retain your User Contributions on our servers in some form. However, removal will render your User Contribution invisible to other users of the Sites. We may, in our sole discretion, decide to anonymize your User Contribution such that you cannot be individually identified, rather than remove the User Contribution. In the event your User Contribution is anonymized, it will remain visible to other users of the Sites. <br />
NSDIGI is not responsible for the removal of User Contributions that are cached, copied, or reposted by third parties. Likewise, to the extent that any provision of federal or state law requires us to maintain certain User Contributions, we will not remove the User Contribution from the Sites. </p>

<p>WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY <br />
No waiver of by us of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and our failure to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. <br />
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect. <br />
Integration <br />
These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and NSDIGI with respect to the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements.</p>
